# Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Product Recommendation

## Project Overview

This project integrates reinforcement learning (RL) into personalized product recommendation systems, focusing on a Monte Carlo RL model that considers both user preferences and budget constraints. The goal is to recommend products by optimizing for both customer satisfaction and budget compliance, providing a dynamic, personalized shopping experience.

### Key Highlights:
- **Monte Carlo RL**: A model-free reinforcement learning approach, utilizing episodes to simulate and evaluate user interactions with products.
- **Budget Constraints**: Recommendations are optimized based on user-defined budget limits, ensuring product suggestions are both personalized and financially feasible.
- **Reward Signals**: The model's performance is analyzed under various reward signal schemes to understand how reward parameters affect convergence and recommendation quality.

## Techniques Used

### Monte Carlo Methods:
- **Episode-Based Learning**: The agent interacts with the environment, gathering data over complete episodes, and revises its value estimates based on the observed returns.
- **Value Estimation**: For a state or state-action pair, the value is estimated by averaging the returns collected from multiple episodes.
- **First-Visit & Every-Visit Methods**: Two approaches for value estimation. First-Visit updates the value on the agent's first visit to a state within an episode, while Every-Visit updates the value every time the state is visited.
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: The agent balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (selecting the best-known actions based on value estimates).

## Process Flow

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Organize and structure the input data (user preferences, product features, and budget) required for the RL model.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - Set initial state values (V) for each action (product). These initial estimates serve as the starting point for the learning process.

3. **Episode Generation**:
   - Simulate episodes in which the agent interacts with the environment (product catalog) and selects products based on user preferences and budget constraints.
   
4. **Terminal Reward Calculation**:
   - After each episode, calculate a terminal reward based on whether the selected products' total cost falls within the specified budget.

5. **Value Update**:
   - Update the value estimates for each action based on the terminal rewards and observed state-action pairs during the episode.


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Model**:
   Execute the Monte Carlo RL script to train the model and evaluate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python src/monte_carlo_rl.py
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**:
   Check the `results/` directory for performance metrics and insights on the recommendation quality.

## Future Work

- **Advanced RL Algorithms**: Explore more sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning or deep RL for enhanced precision.
- **Real-World Data**: Apply the model to real-world datasets to further validate its effectiveness and refine its performance.
